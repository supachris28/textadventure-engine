# ts-textadventure-engine

To play, run `npm i` to install packages, then `npm run go` to compile and run. It will run by default in the console. Swapping out index.ts for an integration of your choice to create the Dungeon and plugging in input and output will allow to run on your own user interface.

Feel free to raise PRs, for either engine improvements, to extend the sample adventure, or to add more samples or whole adventures!
