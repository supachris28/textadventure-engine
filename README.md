# ts-textadventure-engine

To play, run `npm i` to install packages, then `npm run go` to compile and run. It will run by default in the console. Swapping out index.ts for an integration of your choice to create the Dungeon and plugging in input and output will allow to run on your own user interface.

Feel free to raise PRs, for either engine improvements, to extend the sample adventure, or to add more samples or whole adventures!

Debug in VSCode doesn't seem to work with the input library, so just fire it up in a terminal.

If you get stuck and don't want to look at the code, try entering the command `help`. You may need it more than once.
